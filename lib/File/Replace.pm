=head1 Name

File::Replace - Perl extension for replacing files by renaming a temp file over
the original

=head1 Synopsis

=for comment
REMEMBER to keep these examples in sync with 91_author_pod.t

Next to the normal OO constructor, L<C<new>|/new>, this module provides three
interfaces:

 use File::Replace 'replace3';
 
 my ($infh,$outfh,$repl) = replace3($filename);
 while (<$infh>) {
     # write whatever you like to $outfh here
     print $outfh "X: $_";
 }
 $repl->finish;

The following two provide a bit more magic via tied filehandles:

 use File::Replace 'replace2';
 
 my ($infh,$outfh) = replace2($filename);
 while (<$infh>) {
     print $outfh "Y: $_";
 }
 close $infh;   # closing both handles will
 close $outfh;  # trigger the replace

Or the even more magical single filehandle, in which C<print>, C<printf>, and
C<syswrite> go to the output file; C<binmode> to both; C<fileno> only reports
open/closed status; and the other I/O functions go to the input file:

 use File::Replace 'replace';
 
 my $fh = replace($filename);
 while (<$fh>) {
     # can read _and_ write from/to $fh
     print $fh "Z: $_";
 }
 close $fh;

=head1 Description

This module implements and hides the following pattern for you:

=over

=item 1.

Open a temporary file for output

=item 2.

While reading from the original file, write output to the temporary file

=item 3.

C<rename> the temporary file over the original file

=back

In many cases, in particular on many UNIX filesystems, the C<rename> operation
is atomic*. This means that in such cases, the original filename will always
exist, and will always point to either the new or the old version of the file,
so a user attempting to open and read the file will always be able to do so,
and never see an unfinished version of the file while it is being written.

* B<Warning:> Unfortunately, whether or not a rename will actually be atomic in
your specific circumstances is not always an easy question to answer, as it
depends on exact details of the operating system and file system. Consult your
system's documentation and search the Internet for "atomic rename" for more
details. This module's job is to perform the C<rename>, and it can make
B<no guarantees> as to whether it will be atomic or not.

=head2 Version

This documentation describes version 0.09 of this module.
B<This is a development version.>

=head1 Constructors and Overview

The constructors C<< File::Replace->new() >>, C<replace3()>, C<replace2()>, and
C<replace()> take exactly the same arguments, and differ only in their return
values - C<replace2> and C<replace> wrap the functionality of C<File::Replace>
inside C<tie>d filehandles. Note that C<replace3()>, C<replace2()>, and
C<replace()> are normal functions and not methods, don't attempt to call them
as such. If you don't want to import them you can always call them as, for
example, C<File::Replace::replace()>.

 File::Replace->new( $filename );
 File::Replace->new( $filename, $layers );
 File::Replace->new( $filename, option => 'value', ... );
 File::Replace->new( $filename, $layers, option => 'value', ... );
 # replace3(...), replace2(...), and replace(...) take the same arguments

The constructors will open the input file and the temporary output file (the
latter via L<File::Temp|File::Temp>), and will C<die> in case of errors. The
options are described in L</Constructor Options>. It is strongly recommended
that you C<use warnings;>, as then this module will issue warnings which may be
of interest to you.

=head2 C<new>

 use File::Replace;
 my $replace_object = File::Replace->new($filename, ...);

Returns a new C<File::Replace> object. The central methods provided are
C<< ->in_fh >> and C<< ->out_fh >>, which return the input resp. output
filehandle which you can read resp. write, and C<< ->finish >>, which causes
the files to be closed and the replace operation to be performed. There is also
C<< ->cancel >>, which just discards the temporary output file without touching
the input file. Additional helper methods are mentioned below.

C<finish> will C<die> on errors, while C<cancel> will only return a false value
on errors. This module will try to clean up after itself (remove temporary
files) as best it can, even when things go wrong.

Please don't re-C<open> the C<in_fh> and C<out_fh> handles, as this may lead to
confusion.

The method C<< ->is_open >> will return a false value if the replace operation
has been C<finish>ed or C<cancel>ed, or a true value if it is still active
(note that this method does I<not> check the state of the underlying
filehandles). The method C<< ->filename >> returns the filename passed to the
constructor. The method C<< ->options >> in list context returns the options
this object has set (including defaults) as a list of key/value pairs, in
scalar context it returns a hashref of these options.

=head2 C<replace3>

This is a convenience function for shorter code:

 use File::Replace 'replace3';
 my ($in_fh,$out_fh,$repl_obj) = replace3($filename, ...);

is the same as

 use File::Replace;
 my $repl_obj = File::Replace->new($filename, ...);
 my $in_fh    = $repl_obj->in_fh;
 my $out_fh   = $repl_obj->out_fh;

=head2 C<replace2>

 use File::Replace 'replace2';
 my ($input_handle, $output_handle) = replace2($filename, ...);
 my $output_handle = replace2($filename, ...);

In list context, returns a two-element list of two tied filehandles, the first
being the input filehandle, and the second the output filehandle, and the
replace operation (C<finish>) is performed when both handles are C<close>d. In
scalar context, it returns only the output filehandle, and the replace
operation is performed when this handle is C<close>d. This means that C<close>
may C<die> instead of just returning a false value.

You cannot re-C<open> these tied filehandles.

You can access the underlying C<File::Replace> object via
C<< tied(*$handle)->replace >> on both the input and output handle. You can
also access the original, untied filehandles via C<< tied(*$handle)->in_fh >>
and C<< tied(*$handle)->out_fh >>, but please don't C<close> or re-C<open>
these handles as this may lead to confusion.

=head2 C<replace>

 use File::Replace 'replace';
 my $magic_handle = replace($filename, ...);

Returns a single, "magical" tied filehandle. The operations C<print>,
C<printf>, and C<syswrite> are passed through to the output filehandle,
C<binmode> operates on both the input and output handle, and C<fileno> only
reports C<-1> if the C<File::Replace> object is still active or C<undef> if the
replace operation has C<finish>ed or been C<cancel>ed. All other I/O functions,
such as C<< <$handle> >>, C<readline>, C<sysread>, C<seek>, C<tell>, C<eof>,
etc. are passed through to the input handle. You can still access these
operations on the output handle via e.g. C<< eof( tied(*$handle)->out_fh ) >>
or C<< tied(*$handle)->out_fh->tell() >>. The replace operation (C<finish>) is
performed when you C<close> the handle, which means that C<close> may C<die>
instead of just returning a false value.

Re-C<open>ing the handle causes a new underlying C<File::Replace> object to be
created. You should explicitly C<close> the filehandle first so that the
previous replace operation is performed (or C<cancel> that operation). The
"mode" argument (or filename in the case of a two-argument C<open>) may not
contain a read/write indicator (C<< < >>, C<< > >>, etc.), only PerlIO layers.

You can access the underlying C<File::Replace> object via
C<< tied(*$handle)->replace >>. You can also access the original, untied
filehandles via C<< tied(*$handle)->in_fh >> and C<< tied(*$handle)->out_fh >>,
but please don't C<close> or re-C<open> these handles as this may lead to
confusion.

=head1 Constructor Options

=head2 Filename

A filename. The temporary output file will be created in the same directory as
this file, its name will be based on the original filename, but prefixed with a
dot (C<.>) and suffixed with a random string and an extension of C<.tmp>. If
the input file does not exist (C<ENOENT>), then the behavior will depend on the
L</create> option.

=head2 C<layers>

This option can either be specified as the second argument to the constructors,
or as the C<< layers => '...' >> option in the options hash, but not both. It
is a list of PerlIO layers such as C<":utf8">, C<":raw:crlf">, or
C<":encoding(UTF-16)">. Note that the default layers differ based on operating
system, see L<perlfunc/open>.

=head2 C<create>

This option configures the behavior of the module when the input file does not
exist (C<ENOENT>). There are three modes, which you specify as one of the
following strings. If you need more precise control of the input file, see the
L</in_fh> option - note that C<create> is ignored when you use that option.

=over

=item C<"later"> (default when C<create> omitted or C<undef>)

Instead of the input file, F</dev/null> or its equivalent is opened. This means
that while the output file is being written, the input file name will not
exist, and only come into existence when the rename operation is performed.

=item C<"now">

If the input file does not exist, it is immediately created and opened. There
is currently a potential race condition: if the file is created by another
process before this module can create it, then the behavior is undefined - the
file may be emptied of its contents, or you may be able to read its contents.
This behavior may be fixed and specified in a future version. The race
condition is discussed some more in L</Concurrency and File Locking>.

Currently, this option is implemented by opening the file with a mode of
C<< +> >>, meaning that it is created (clobbered) and opened in read-write
mode. I<However>, that should be considered an implementation detail that is
subject to change. Do not attempt to take advantage of the read-write mode by
writing to the input file - that contradicts the purpose of this module anyway.
Instead, the input file will exist and remain empty until the replace
operation.

=item C<"off"> (or C<"no">)

Attempting to open a nonexistent input file will cause the constructor to
C<die>.

=back

Previous versions of this module included support for other values of the
C<create> option, as well as the C<devnull> option. These were replaced by the
above C<create> options and deprecated in 0.06, and removed as of 0.08. Using
unrecognized options will result in a fatal error. Note that in 0.06,
specifying C<undef> for the C<create> option resulted in a deprecation warning,
that behavior has now been changed so that C<undef> is equivalent to the
C<create> option not being set.

=head2 C<in_fh>

This option allows you to pass an existing input filehandle to this module,
instead of having the constructors open the input file for you. Use this option
if you need more precise control over how the input file is opened, e.g. if you
want to use C<sysopen> to open it. The handle must be open, which will be
checked by calling C<fileno> on the handle. The module makes no attempt to
check that the filename you pass to the module matches the filehandle. The
module will attempt to C<stat> the handle to get its permissions, except when
you have specified the L</perms> option or disabled the L</chmod> option. The
L</create> option is ignored when you use this option.

=head2 C<perms>

 perms => 0640       # ok
 perms => oct("640") # ok
 perms => "0640"     # WRONG!

Normally, just before the C<rename> is performed, C<File::Replace> will
C<chmod> the temporary file to those permissions that the original file had
when it was opened, or, if the original file did not yet exist, default
permissions based on the current C<umask>. Setting this option to an octal
value (a number, not a string!) will override those permissions. See also
L</chmod>, which can be used to disable the C<chmod> operation.

=head2 C<chmod>

This option is enabled by default, unless you set
C<$File::Replace::DISABLE_CHMOD> to a true value. When you disable this option,
the C<chmod> operation that is normally performed just before the C<rename>
will not be attempted. This is mostly intended for systems where you know the
C<chmod> will fail. See also L</perms>, which allows you to define what
permissions will be used.

Note that the temporary files created with L<File::Temp|File::Temp> will have
0600 permissions if left unchanged (except of course on systems that don't
support these kind of restrictive permissions).

=head2 C<autocancel>

If the C<File::Replace> object is destroyed (e.g. when it goes out of scope),
and the replace operation has not been performed yet, normally it will
C<cancel> the replace operation and issue a warning. Enabling this option makes
that implicit canceling explicit, silencing the warning.

This option cannot be used together with C<autofinish>.

=head2 C<autofinish>

When set, causes the C<finish> operation to be attempted when the object is
destroyed (e.g. when it goes out of scope).

However, using this option is actually B<not recommended> unless you know what
you are doing. This is because the replace operation will also be attempted
when your script is C<die>ing, in which case the output file may be incomplete,
and you may not want the original file to be replaced. A second reason is that
the replace operation may be attempted during global destruction, and it is not
a good idea to rely on this always going well. In general it is better to
C<finish> the replace operation explicitly.

This option cannot be used together with C<autocancel>.

=head2 C<debug>

If set to a true value, this option enables some debug output for C<new>,
C<finish>, and C<cancel>. You may also set this to a filehandle, and debug
output will be sent there.

=head1 Additional Methods

=head2 C<copy>

This method copies a certain number of "characters" from the input handle to
the output handle, that is, the temporary file. Depending on the status of the
filehandle, either (8-bit) bytes or characters are read, see L<perlfunc/read>.
The option C<bufsize> lets you adjust the read buffer size, and the option
C<< less=>'ignore' >> or C<< less=>'ok' >> suppresses the warning that less
characters than you requested could be read. The method returns the number of
characters copied and dies on errors.

 use File::Replace;
 my $repl = File::Replace->new($filename, ...);
 $repl->copy(8);                   # copy eight characters
 $repl->copy(1024, bufsize=>256);  # copy 1024 chars, 256 at a time
 $repl->copy(2048, less=>'ok');    # copy 2048, but don't warn if less
 $repl->finish;

This method was added in version 0.08.

=head1 Notes and Caveats

=head2 Concurrency and File Locking

This module is very well suited for situations where a file has one writer and
one or more readers.

Among other things, this is reflected in the case of a nonexistent file, where
the L</create> settings C<now> and C<later> (the default) are currently
implemented as a two-step process, meaning there is the potential of the input
file being created in the short period of time between the first and second
C<open> attempts, which this module currently will not notice.

Having multiple writers is possible, but care must be taken to ensure proper
coordination of the writers!

For example, a simple L<flock|perlfunc/flock> of the input file is B<not>
enough: if there are multiple processes, remember that each process will
I<replace> the original input file by a new and different file! One possible
solution would be a separate lock file that does not change and is only used
for C<flock>ing. There are other possible methods, but that is currently beyond
the scope of this documentation.

(For the sake of completeness, note that you cannot C<flock> the C<tie>d
handles, only the underlying filehandles.)
