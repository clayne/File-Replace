=head1 Name

Tie::Handle::Base - A base class for tied filehandles

=head1 Synopsis

=for comment
REMEMBER to keep these examples in sync with 91_author_pod.t

 package Tie::Handle::Mine;
 use parent 'Tie::Handle::Base';
 sub WRITE {
     my $self = shift;
     print STDERR "Debug: Output '$_[0]'\n";
     return $self->SUPER::WRITE(@_);
 }

Then use your custom tied handle:

 open my $fh, '>', $filename or die $!;
 $fh = Tie::Handle::Mine->new($fh);  # replace orig. handle with tied
 print $fh "Hello, World";           # debug message will be printed
 close $fh;

=head1 Description

A base class for tied filehandles similar to L<Tie::StdHandle|Tie::StdHandle>,
but with a few important differences.

=over

=item *

The C<tied> object is a hashref, so that subclasses have an easier time storing
information in the object hash. The inner handle which is wrapped by this tied
handle should be passed to its C<TIEHANDLE> and is stored with the hash key
C<_innerhandle>. Subclasses should consider all fields with an underscore as
reserved. If no handle is passed to C<TIEHANDLE>, it will create a new
anonymous one as the inner handle.

=item *

It provides a constructor C<new> which will create a new lexical filehandle,
C<tie> it to the class, and return that filehandle. Any arguments to C<new> are
passed through to C<TIEHANDLE>, including the (optional) inner handle as the
first argument. Subclasses may choose to override C<new> and/or C<TIEHANDLE> to
modify this behavior.

=item *

A few limitations that exist in L<Tie::StdHandle|Tie::StdHandle> (at least
versions up to and including 4.4) have been lifted: C<BINMODE> accepts the
C<LAYER> argument, and C<WRITE> will return the length of the string written
(similar caveats in regards to Unicode/UTF-8 data as documented in
L<syswrite|perlfunc/syswrite> apply).

=item *

Although the functions C<PRINT> and C<PRINTF> are implemented in terms of
C<WRITE>, so that you can modify the output behavior by only overriding
C<WRITE>, C<WRITE> itself is implemented in terms of a function C<_WRITE> which
takes a filehandle and emulates C<syswrite> behavior using the core C<print>.
This might be an important detail to you if you are overriding any of these
functions; see the code for details.

=back

This documentation describes version 0.03 of this module.
B<This is a development version.>

=head2 Notes

B<See Also:> L<perltie>, L<perlfunc/tie>, L<Tie::Handle>, L<Tie::StdHandle>

The full list of functions that tied handles can/should implement is:

 BINMODE, CLOSE, DESTROY,  EOF,  FILENO, GETC,      OPEN,  PRINT,
 PRINTF,  READ,  READLINE, SEEK, TELL,   TIEHANDLE, UNTIE, WRITE
