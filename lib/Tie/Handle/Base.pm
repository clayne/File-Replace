=head1 Name

Tie::Handle::Base - A base class for tied filehandles

=head1 Synopsis

=for comment
REMEMBER to keep these examples in sync with 91_author_pod.t

 package Tie::Handle::Mine;
 use parent 'Tie::Handle::Base';
 sub WRITE {
     my $self = shift;
     print STDERR "Debug: Output '$_[0]'\n";
     return $self->SUPER::WRITE(@_);
 }

Then use your custom tied handle:

 open my $fh, '>', $filename or die $!;
 $fh = Tie::Handle::Mine->new($fh);  # replace orig. handle with tied
 print $fh "Hello, World";           # debug message will be printed
 close $fh;

=head1 Description

C<Tie::Handle::Base> is a base class for tied filehandles. It is similar to
L<Tie::StdHandle|Tie::StdHandle>, but provides a few more features, and is
compatible down to Perl 5.8.1. It tries to be as transparent as possible (one
limitation is that C<sysread> and C<syswrite> are only emulated, as described
in L</READ>).

A few limitations that exist in L<Tie::StdHandle|Tie::StdHandle> (at least
versions up to and including 4.4) have been lifted: C<BINMODE> accepts the
C<LAYER> argument, and C<WRITE> will return the length of the string written.

This documentation describes version 0.05 of this module.
B<This is a development version.>

B<See Also:> L<perltie>, L<perlfunc/tie>, L<Tie::Handle>, L<Tie::StdHandle>

=head1 Examples

=head2 Debugging

This is a slightly "fancier" version of the example presented in the
L</Synopsis>, this prints all calls on the tied handle using
L<Class::Method::Modifiers|Class::Method::Modifiers>'s C<before> and
L<Data::Dump|Data::Dump>.

 package Tie::Handle::Debug;
 use parent 'Tie::Handle::Base';
 use Class::Method::Modifiers 'before';
 use Data::Dump 'dd';
 for my $method (@Tie::Handle::Base::ALL_METHODS) {
     before $method => sub { dd $method, @_[1..$#_] };
 }

=head2 Tee

Here is a simple "tee" implementation - anything written to the tied handle via
C<print>, C<printf>, and C<syswrite> will end up being written to all handles
given to C<new> (the first handle being the "main" handle that all the other
I/O functions in this example, including C<close>, are performed on).

 package Tie::Handle::Tee;
 use parent 'Tie::Handle::Base';
 sub TIEHANDLE {
     my ($class,$main,@others) = @_;
     my $self = $class->SUPER::TIEHANDLE($main);
     $self->{others} = \@others;
     return $self;
 }
 sub WRITE {
     my $self = shift;
     $self->inner_write($_, @_) for @{$self->{others}};
     return $self->SUPER::WRITE(@_);
 }

Note that you may wrap one tied handle in another - for example,
C<< my $fh = Tie::Handle::Debug->new( Tie::Handle::Tee->new(@handles) ) >>.

=head1 Methods

This section documents the methods of this class. Those methods that
wrap/emulate Perl's functionality also attempt to emulate the return values of
the original Perl functions.

=head2 C<new>

C<new> will create a new lexical filehandle, C<tie> it to the class (thus
invoking L</TIEHANDLE>), and return that filehandle. Any arguments to C<new>
are passed through to C<TIEHANDLE>, including the (optional) inner handle as
the first argument.

It is recommended for subclasses to override C<TIEHANDLE> instead of C<new>, as
this will provide a more consistent interface for users wishing to use Perl's
C<tie> instead of C<new>.

=head2 C<TIEHANDLE>

This method takes a single optional argument, which is the inner handle which
is wrapped by the tied handle. If this inner handle is not given, the method
will create a new lexical filehandle that is otherwise uninitialized. The
method then creates a new hashref which will serve as the object of the
specified class, and which implements the tied interface based on this class.
This object is also what is returned by C<tied(*$handle)>.

Subclasses may store whatever they like in this hashref, I<except> that keys
beginning with two underscores (C<__>) are reserved for this base class.
Subclasses overriding this method should still call it via the usual
C<< $class->SUPER::TIEHANDLE(...) >>.

=head2 C<UNTIE> and C<DESTROY>

These methods discard the inner handle which this class wraps. Subclasses
overriding these methods should call the superclass methods.

=head2 C<innerhandle>

This method returns the inner handle which is wrapped by this class.

Subclasses wishing to change the inner handle may do so with the
C<set_inner_handle> method, which takes a single argument, the new inner
handle.

=head2 C<OPEN>

This implementation will first call the C<FILENO> method and check for
C<defined>ness to see if the inner handle is still open, and if it is, call the
C<CLOSE> method before calling Perl's C<open> to open the inner handle.

=head2 C<PRINT>, C<PRINTF>, and C<WRITE>

The methods C<PRINT> and C<PRINTF> emulate the Perl functions by the same name
by building the output strings and passing them to the C<WRITE> method. This
means that subclasses can modify output behavior by overriding only the
C<WRITE> method. C<WRITE> itself is simply a call to L</inner_write>.

=head2 C<inner_write>

This function, intended for use by subclasses, may be called as either a simple
function, or as a method on the object, so that subclasses may call
C<< $self->inner_write($handle, ...) >>. In either case, the argument list must
be the same as that of C<syswrite>, including the filehandle which to output on
as the first argument. This function emulates C<syswrite> behavior using
C<substr> and Perl's C<print>. It does not use C<syswrite> internally in order
to be analogous to the L</READ> implementation.

=head2 C<READ>

Perl's tied filehandle interface will call this method for both C<read> and
C<sysread> calls. This method calls Perl's C<read>, not C<sysread>, because the
latter would bypass buffered I/O and cause confusion with other buffered I/O
methods such as C<seek>, C<tell>, and C<eof>.

This means that one limitation of this base class is that, while users may call
C<sysread> and C<syswrite> on the tied handles, these calls will I<not> be
translated into C<sysread/write> calls on the inner, wrapped handle.
(See L</inner_write> regarding C<syswrite>.)

=head2 All Other Methods

The methods
B<< C<BINMODE>, C<CLOSE>, C<EOF>, C<FILENO>, C<GETC>, C<READLINE>, C<SEEK>, and C<TELL> >>
are implemented in this class by calling the Perl functions of the same name.

The full list of methods that tied handles can/should implement is as follows.
The list of names is provided as C<@Tie::Handle::Base::ALL_METHODS>, and the
list C<@Tie::Handle::Base::IO_METHODS> excludes C<TIEHANDLE>, C<UNTIE>, and
C<DESTROY>.

and C<printf> get special handling by Perl and therefore do not report a
standard prototype.
